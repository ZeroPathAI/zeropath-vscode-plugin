## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No workspace folder found"**
- Ensure you have a folder open in VS Code
- The folder must be a Git repository with initialized `.git` directory

**"Could not determine git remote URL"**
- Verify your repository has a remote origin configured
- Run `git remote -v` to check your remotes

**"ZeroPath organization not found"**
- Check your API credentials are correct
- Ensure your token has access to at least one organization
- The extension auto-detects the organization from your API token
- You can manually set `zeropath.organizationId` in settings if needed

**"Failed to apply patch"**
- Ensure you have no uncommitted changes
- The patch may conflict with local modifications
- Try pulling the latest changes first
